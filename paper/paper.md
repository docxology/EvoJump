  Developmental biology and evolutionary genetics require sophisticated analytical frameworks to characterize the complex, often discontinuous nature of phenotypic change across ontogeny. We present EvoJump, a comprehensive computational framework that conceptualizes developmental trajectories as stochastic processes sweeping across analytical cross-sections, enabling the characterization of both continuous developmental dynamics and discrete evolutionary transitions. The framework implements multiple classes of stochastic processes including jump-diffusion models, fractional Brownian motion, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes, and LÃ©vy processes, integrated with advanced statistical methodologies including wavelet analysis, copula methods, extreme value theory, and regime-switching algorithms. Through comprehensive benchmarking and validation, we demonstrate the framework's capabilities for analyzing developmental trajectories, identifying evolutionary constraints, and predicting phenotypic outcomes. EvoJump represents a significant advance in computational tools for evolutionary developmental biology, enabling researchers to address fundamental questions about the mechanistic basis of phenotypic evolution.
