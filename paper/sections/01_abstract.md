# Abstract

Biological development unfolds as a stochastic process characterized by continuous variation and discrete transitions, yet traditional analytical methods fail to capture this complexity. We present **EvoJump**, a unified computational framework that models developmental trajectories as stochastic processes analyzed through cross-sectional "laser plane" views of phenotypic distributions.

EvoJump integrates multiple stochastic process models—jump-diffusion, fractional Brownian motion, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Lévy processes—with advanced statistical methods including wavelet analysis, copula modeling, extreme value theory, and regime-switching detection. This comprehensive platform enables:

- Analysis of developmental trajectories and evolutionary constraints
- Prediction of phenotypic outcomes with uncertainty quantification
- Identification of developmental phase transitions and dependencies

Implemented in Python with comprehensive testing framework and extensive documentation, EvoJump bridges quantitative genetics and modern computational methods, enabling researchers to address fundamental questions about the mechanistic basis of phenotypic evolution across ontogeny. The framework demonstrates robust performance with synthetic data validation and scales efficiently to large phenotyping datasets.
