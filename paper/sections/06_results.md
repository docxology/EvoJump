# Results and Validation

We validate EvoJump's implementation through synthetic data experiments, integration tests, and demonstration of key capabilities using the comprehensive test suite.

## Implementation Validation

All stochastic process models were validated through systematic testing to ensure correct implementation of theoretical properties.

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process

Test suite validates OU process with jumps using synthetic trajectories with known parameters:

**Core Properties Verified**:
- Mean-reverting behavior toward specified equilibrium
- Jump events correctly simulated using compound Poisson process
- Trajectory simulation produces finite, reasonable values across parameter ranges
- Parameter estimation methods converge to expected values
- Log-likelihood computation functions correctly

### Fractional Brownian Motion

fBM implementation tested across full Hurst parameter range ($H \in (0,1)$):

**Core Properties Verified**:
- Persistent trajectories ($H > 0.5$) exhibit positive autocorrelation
- Anti-persistent trajectories ($H < 0.5$) show oscillatory mean-reversion
- Standard Brownian motion ($H = 0.5$) recovered as special case
- Parameter estimation successfully distinguishes persistence regimes
- Covariance structure follows theoretical fBM properties

### Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Process

**Core Properties Verified**:
- Non-negativity constraint satisfied across all test scenarios
- Square-root diffusion term correctly dampens noise near zero
- Mean-reversion toward equilibrium observed
- Stationary distribution approximates theoretical Gamma form
- Feller condition properly enforced

### Lévy Process

$\alpha$-stable Lévy processes tested for heavy-tailed behavior:

**Core Properties Verified**:
- Chambers-Mallows-Stuck algorithm generates stable random variables
- Heavy-tailed distributions ($\alpha < 2$) produce extreme events as expected
- Skewness parameter correctly controls distribution asymmetry
- Stability parameter determines tail behavior
- Integration with jump-diffusion framework functions correctly

## Statistical Methods Validation

Advanced statistical methods demonstrated using synthetic test cases designed to highlight specific capabilities.

### Wavelet Analysis

Tested on synthetic oscillatory signals with known frequency components:

**Capabilities Demonstrated**:
- Time-frequency decomposition identifies dominant scales
- Multi-scale analysis reveals temporal patterns
- Power spectrum computation highlights frequency content
- Event detection identifies transient features

Note: Wavelet analysis requires PyWavelets package.

### Copula Methods

Validated using synthetic data with known dependence structures:

**Capabilities Demonstrated**:
- Gaussian copula captures symmetric dependence
- Clayton copula identifies lower tail dependence
- Frank copula models moderate tail dependence
- Kendall's tau correctly computed for dependence strength
- Rank-based transformations preserve dependence structure
