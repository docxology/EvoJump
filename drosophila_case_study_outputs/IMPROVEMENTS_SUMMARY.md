# Drosophila Case Study Improvements - September 30, 2025

## Overview
The Drosophila melanogaster case study has been significantly improved and expanded to provide clearer biological insights and more comprehensive evolutionary dynamics.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Extended Simulation Timeline
- **Before**: 15 generations
- **After**: 100 generations
- **Benefit**: Allows observation of complete selective sweep to near-fixation, long-term allele frequency trajectories, and breakdown of linkage disequilibrium

### 2. Clarified Two-Level Trait Model
We now explicitly model two distinct but correlated traits:

#### Eye Color (Genetic Trait)
- **Type**: Discrete genetic marker (red vs. white)
- **Role**: Target of natural selection
- **Fitness**: Red-eyed flies have 20% fitness advantage (w = 1.2)
- **Selection coefficient**: s = 0.15

#### Eye Size (Phenotypic Trait)
- **Type**: Continuous morphological phenotype
- **Role**: Correlated marker trait
- **Mechanism**: Linked to eye color through pleiotropy or tight genetic linkage
- **Effect size**: Red-eyed flies have larger eyes (+2.5 arbitrary units on average)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates how selection on one trait drives evolution in genetically correlated traits

### 3. Improved Scientific Communication
- Column names changed to be more descriptive:
  - `genotype` → `eye_color_genotype` and `eye_color`
  - `phenotype` → `eye_size`
  - `allele_frequency` → `red_allele_frequency`
- Enhanced documentation explaining biological mechanisms
- Clearer figure captions and axis labels

### 4. Results from 100-Generation Simulation

#### Genetic Dynamics
- **Initial red-eye allele frequency**: 0.10 (10%)
- **Final red-eye allele frequency**: 0.97 (97%)
- **Allele frequency change**: 0.87
- **Estimated generations to fixation**: ~30 generations
- **Selective sweep detected**: ✅ Yes

#### Phenotypic Evolution
- **Initial mean eye size**: 10.17 arbitrary units
- **Final mean eye size**: 12.43 arbitrary units
- **Evolutionary rate**: 0.023 units per generation
- **Eye size variance**: 1.51

#### Population Genetics
- **Effective population size**: 100
- **Selection coefficient**: 0.15
- **Heritability (eye size)**: 0.5
- **Genetic hitchhiking detected**: ✅ Yes
- **Average linkage disequilibrium**: 0.697

### 5. Enhanced Visualizations
All three figures now show 100-generation dynamics:

- **Figure 7** (Selective Sweep): Shows complete S-shaped logistic increase from 10% to 97%
- **Figure 8** (Network Analysis**: Neutral markers sampled every 5 generations across 100-generation timeline
- **Figure 9** (Cross-sections): Distributions at generations 10, 50, and 90 (early, mid, and late sweep)

### 6. Scientific Insights

The extended simulation reveals:

1. **Complete Selective Sweep**: Advantageous allele reaches near-fixation (>95%) 
2. **Correlated Response**: Eye size evolves as a correlated response to selection on eye color
3. **Linkage Disequilibrium**: Neutral markers show hitchhiking effects inversely proportional to linkage distance
4. **Selection-Drift Balance**: Stochastic drift effects visible early in sweep, deterministic selection dominates later
5. **Fixation Dynamics**: Approach to fixation shows characteristic slowing as frequency approaches 1

### 7. Educational Value

The improved case study now effectively demonstrates:

- Distinction between genetic targets of selection vs. phenotypic consequences
- How pleiotropy and linkage create correlated evolutionary responses
- Long-term dynamics of selective sweeps beyond typical classroom experiments
- Quantitative population genetics concepts with real-world biological relevance

## Technical Implementation

### Code Improvements
- Proper type annotations and documentation
- Clear variable naming (`eye_color` vs. `eye_size`)
- Modular data generation with configurable parameters
- Comprehensive error handling

### Reproducibility
- Fixed random seed (42) for reproducible results
- All parameters documented in code and reports
- JSON output with complete metadata
- Figure generation script runs independently
